 	     <p> As you can see I have tons of pretty cool skills, like web development, but did you also know I am an IT extrodinarre? A jack of all sorts of trades, I can manage your server, to host your website, which apparently I can also design for you... why do you even need anyone else? give me all your work, you probably wont be sorry...   </p>
<!--this is the experience section -->
	<h2 id="h2"> Experience </h2>	
		<p>  Over the many many years of my young professional career, I have had 2 jobs... ok so its not that many..  </p>
		<p>  My first gig was as an IT Technician at an automotive manufacturing plant, and let me tell you, it was love at first sight... JK </p>
		<p>  After several years building up a solid foundation of IT knowledge I decided to give the startup life a try.. and let me tell you, if you think automotive manufacturing is a stressful environment, let me tell you.. STARTUP life is insane... stressful but for completely different reasons...  </p>
		<p>  Once I was exposed to this start up life, I became completely fascinated with the world of software development.. I needed to understand how it worked... I transfered from an IT position, to a QA position where I could be closer to the action, and learn the ins and outs of Web Development.</p>
